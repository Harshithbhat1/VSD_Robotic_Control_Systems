However, individual sensors like GPS, accelerometers,gyroscopes, or encoders each come with inherent limitations such as noise, drift, or latency. To overcome these shortcomings, sensor fusion techniques are used to combine information from multiple sensors, resulting in a more accurate and stable estimate of the system’s true state.

Among various fusion algorithms, the Kalman filter stands out as a powerful predictive algorithm for fusing noisy sensor data, especially when dealing with linear dynamic systems. While traditionally implemented in software, a hardware implementation of the Kalman filter using Verilog on a System-on-Chip (SoC) provides significant advantages in terms of low latency, parallelism, and real-time processing, which are essential for responsive and energy-efficient robotic control systems.

This project aims to design and implement a Kalman filter in hardware to fuse data from sensors commonly used in robotics—such as an IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) and a GPS receiver—to estimate the robot’s position and velocity more accurately. By moving this computation to a dedicated hardware block, the robot’s main processor is freed for higher-level decision-making, and system responsiveness is significantly improved.
