**Task 2**

1) **Implementing 1D Kalman filter with equations**

Takes 8-bit measurements as input (e.g., sensor readings).

Performs filtering using Kalman equations.

Outputs a smoothed prediction using fixed-point math.

2) **Simulation of I2C master**(for IMU sensor)

Generating the I2C start and stop conditions.

Writing 8-bit data to a slave.

Sending ACK/NACK and clocking over SCL/SDA lines.
